# We need to define the formula for RPS and calculate it for the given stock data
# RPS = (n - r + 1) / n * 100, where n is the lookback period and r is the rank of the stock's performance within that period

# First, we need to import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Next, we need to read in the stock data
stock_data = pd.read_csv('/path/to/stock_data.csv')

# We need to specify the lookback period (n) and calculate the rank (r) of the stock's performance within that period
n = 90 # for example, we can use a 90-day lookback period
stock_data['r'] = stock_data['returns'].rolling(n).apply(lambda x: pd.Series(x).rank(pct=True).iloc[-1])

# Finally, we can calculate the RPS for each day in the dataset
stock_data['RPS'] = (n - stock_data['r'] + 1) / n * 100

# The resulting RPS values can be found in the 'RPS' column of the stock_data dataframe. 45
